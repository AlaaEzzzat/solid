  <section>
    <p>
      <strong>SOLID</strong> is an acronym that stands for five principles of
      object-oriented programming and design. It was introduced by
      <strong>Robert C. Martin</strong> in the early 2000s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SOLID principles were developed to address common problems that arise
      in software development, such as code that is difficult to maintain,
      modify, or extend. By adhering to these principles, developers can create
      code that is more robust, flexible, and easier to work with.
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">The five principles of SOLID are:</p>
    <ul class="mb-4">
      <li><strong>S</strong>: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
      <li><strong>O</strong>: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</li>
      <li><strong>L</strong>: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</li>
      <li><strong>I</strong>: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</li>
      <li><strong>D</strong>: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</li>
    </ul>
