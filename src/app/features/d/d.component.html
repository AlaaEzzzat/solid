  <h2>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):</h2>
  <p>
    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
    depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details
    should depend on abstractions. This means that you should depend on
    abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
